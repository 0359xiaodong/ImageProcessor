    <h1>ImageProcessor.Web</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>ImageProcessor.Web</strong> is a web extension to ImageProcessor that allows the developer to perform image manipulation using querystring parameters as instructions.
    </p>
    <p>This works by adding a configurable HttpModule to your website which intercepts local and remote image requests, processing them on-the-fly to your desired output.</p>
    <p>
        The API for ImageProcessor.Web is imperative. This means that the order in which you supply the querystring parameters is the order in which the individual processors are implemented.
        This allows the API to be very flexible, allowing you to combine processes in any order.

    <h1>Caching</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>ImageProcessor.Web</strong> comes with caching as standard. Any processed image are asynchronously cached both in the browser and on the server for a length of your choosing.
        The server cache intelligently stores millions of images and silently updates itself should the original image change or the cache expire.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cached files are stored in nested folders based on an SHA1 representation of the full url. This ensures that the OS does not suffer from any slowdown due to file indexing.
    </p>
    <p>
        This saves massive amounts of processing power and bandwidth that help to keep your website snappy.
