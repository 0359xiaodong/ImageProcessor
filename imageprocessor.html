    <h1>ImageProcessor</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>ImageProcessor</strong> contains all the core functionality that allows for image manipulation via the <code>ImageFactory</code> class. 
    This has a fluent API which allows you to easily chain methods to deliver the desired output. This library contains no web 
    specific components so is suitable for both desktop and web applications.
    </p>

    <p>Currently the system supports processing of jpg, jpeg, png, png8, gif, bmp, and tif file formats.</p>

    <h1>Plugin Based</h1>
    <p>
        ImageProcessor is built with extensibility in mind. All the individual processors follow an interface <code>IGraphicsprocessor</code> which allows developers
        to easily extend the library. View the <a href="https://github.com/JimBobSquarePants/ImageProcessor/tree/master/src/ImageProcessor/Processors">source code</a> to see examples.
